# In this problem, you will implement the binary search algorithm 
# that allows searching very efficiently (even huge) lists, 
# provided that the list is sorted

# Task: The goal in this code problem is to implement the binary search algorithm.
# Input Format:
# The first line of the input contains an integer n and a sequence a0 < a1 < ... < an-1 of n pairwise distinct positive integers in increasing order. 
# The next line contains an integer k and k positive integers b0, b1, ..., bk-1
# Constraints: 1 <= n, k <= 10^4 for all 0 <= i < n; 1 <= bj <= 10^9 for all 0 <= j < k
# OutputFormat: For all i from 0 to k -1,output an index 0 <= j <= n - 1 
# such that aj = bi or âˆ’1 if there is no such index.
