# You are going to travel to another city that is located d miles away from your home city. 
# Your can can travel at most m miles on a full tank 
# and you start with a full tank. 
# Along your way, there are gas stations at distances 
# stop1, stop2, . . . , stopn from your home city. 
# What is the minimum number of refills needed?

# Input Format: 
# |-- The first line contains an integer d. 
# |-- The second line contains an integer m. 
# |-- The third line specifies an integer n.
# |-- Finally, the last line contains integers stop1, stop2, . . . , stopn
# Input Format: Assuming that the distance between the cities is d miles, a car can travel at most m miles on a full tank, and there are gas stations at distances stop1 , stop2 , . . . , stopn along the way, output the minimum number of refills needed. Assume that the car starts with a full tank. If it is not possible to reach the destination, output âˆ’1.
